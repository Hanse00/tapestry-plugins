4. Enter a name for your app, e.g. "Tapestry", and select the workspace to install the app in and then select "Create App".
5. Add a redirect URL by select "OAuth & Permissions" in the sidebar followed by "Add New Redirect URL", set the URL to [https://iconfactory.com/tapestry-oauth](https://iconfactory.com/tapestry-oauth), and save the changes.
6. Scroll down to "Scopes" and add the following scopes under "User Token Scopes": `channels:history`, `channels:read`, and `users.profile:read`.
